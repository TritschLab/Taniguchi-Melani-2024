%LoadWF - Load waveforms
%
%   WF = loadWF(clusters,datFF,nChan,Fs);
%   WF = loadWF(clusters,datFF,nChan,Fs,params);
%
%   Description: This code utilizes organized cluster data (with max channel
%   information) to pull the mean waveforms of all the spikes from the raw
%   data and it stores a randomly selected number of user specified
%   waveforms.
%
%   Input:
%       data - Data structure containing cluster information
%       datPath - A string containing the full path to the dat file
%       nChan - Number of channels in the recording
%       Fs - Sampling rate of acquisition
%       params (optional) - A structure containing information on the
%       window for the waveforms in ms and number of waveforms to read
%
%   Output:
%       WF - A structure containing information about waveforms associated with the input clusters
