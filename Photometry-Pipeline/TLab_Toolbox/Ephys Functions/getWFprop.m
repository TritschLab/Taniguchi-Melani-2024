function [WF] = getWFprop(WF, varargin)
%Computation of waveform properties
% 
% Description: This function will compute values for various waveform
%   properties (temporal, shape) based on coordinates for waveform features
%   determined by pre-processing with processWF. 
%
% [WF] = getWFprop(WF, varargin)
%
% INPUT
%   'WF' - structure, pre-processed with processWF
%   varargin
%       {1} 'units' - vector of units to iterate waveform analysis over
%
% OUTPUT
%   WF - structure updated to now include:
%       'WF.peakLatency' = in ms, time between minimum and second maximum. 
%       'WF.halfWidth' = in ms, time width of the spike at half-maximal amplitude of the first maximum. 
%       'WF.amplitude' = in uV, difference between the second maximum and the minimum. 
%       'WF.asymmetry' = ratio of the amplitude of the second maximum to that amplitude of the first maximum.
%       'WF.ratioPkTr' = ratio of peak to trough, between first maximum and minimum
%       'WF.timePkPk'  = in ms, peak-to-peak time between first maximum and second maximum
