% Description: 
%   Identify spike of n'th unit that is closest to specified event time,
%   then find spike of m'th unit closest that of the n'th unit. 
%   Delta-t is the time difference between spike(m) and spike(n).
%   Repeat for all cell pairs, then repeat over multiple event times. 
%   Average delta-t for each cell pair over all events, and then average
%   all the cell pairs for each latency/shift.
%
% INPUT
%   'st' - cell array with unit spike times, in seconds
%   'events' - vector with event times, in seconds
%   'range' (optional) - vector of event latencies, in seconds
%
% OUTPUT
%   'muDeltaT' - matrix with delta-t averaged over all events for each cell
%       pair at each latency, where columns correspond to cell pairs and
%       rows correspond to different latencies from event times.
%   'range' - vector of event latencties, in seconds
